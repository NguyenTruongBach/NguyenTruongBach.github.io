#### Introduction

As SaaS (Software as a Service) applications become increasingly prevalent, the **Multi-Tenant Database Architecture** model has emerged as a key solution for businesses to optimize costs, simplify infrastructure management, and still ensure security and scalability. On AWS, this architecture enables multiple customers (tenants) to share the same database system, while each tenant’s data remains logically separated and securely protected.

The topic **"Implementing Multi-Tenant Database Architecture on AWS"** will guide you step-by-step through designing, deploying, and operating a basic SaaS system using the **Shared Database – Shared Schema** model, combined with AWS services such as RDS, Elastic Beanstalk, Cognito, and CloudWatch. Through this workshop, you will gain a clear understanding of how multi-tenant architecture works, learn practical deployment techniques, and be able to apply them to SaaS projects.

#### Solution Architecture and AWS Services Used

The Multi-Tenant Database Architecture solution on AWS is built upon the following AWS services:

- **Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL/MySQL)**: Hosts the multi-tenant database.
- **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**: Deploys and manages the backend API.
- **Amazon Cognito**: Authenticates and authorizes users, storing the `tenant_id`.
- **Amazon S3**: Stores static content (frontend, documents).
- **Amazon CloudWatch**: Monitors performance and system logs.
- **AWS Lambda** *(optional)*: Handles background tasks or automation.
- **Amazon SNS** *(optional)*: Sends notifications when system events occur.

These services work together to deliver a simple yet effective SaaS solution that optimizes costs, enhances scalability, and ensures secure data isolation for each tenant.
